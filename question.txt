where each user document has a reference (e.g., userId) to one or more 
gasCylinders, write a MongoDB query that efficiently retrieves a specific user 
document along with an array of all the gasCylinders associated with that user, 
in a single database query.
Question 4
Suppose you live in a city where the streets are arranged in a perfect grid. 
You decide to go for a walk, and at each intersection, you randomly choose your next direction.

Your four options are NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST, and backtracking is allowed. Once your walk is finished, 
you check how far you are from the point where you started. If you are more than 4 blocks away, 
you'll pay for transport back home; otherwise, you'll walk.



What is the longest random walk you can take so that, on average, you end up 4 blocks or fewer away from home?
